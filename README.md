### Project Description
India is a country with a large and growing population. The agricultural sector is essential to meeting the food needs of the population. However, the agricultural sector is facing a number of challenges, including climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation.
This project aims to analyze the agricultural sector in India and propose strategic decision-making based on population trends. 
The project will examine the following:
        The current state of the agricultural sector in India
        The challenges and opportunities facing the agricultural sector
        The impact of population trends on the agricultural sector
### Strategic decisions that can be made to address the challenges and opportunities facing the agricultural sector
The project will use data from the Government of India on crop production, farming techniques, and infrastructure. The data will be cleaned and processed using Python and Pandas. The data will be analyzed using EDA techniques to identify trends and patterns. The findings of the analysis will be used to propose strategic decisions that can be made to address the challenges and opportunities facing the agricultural sector.
